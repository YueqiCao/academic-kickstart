 abstract = {Symmetric positive definite matrix has a widely application in many branches of science and engineering, a key issue is about how to find the ‘nice’ distance between two elements on $SPD(n)$ consisting of symmetric positive definite matrices. By using the fiber bundle and constructing a Riemannian submersion from the general linear group $GL(n)$ to $SPD(n)$, we develop the closed-form expressions of a new Riemannian metric and associated Riemannian distance in $SPD(n)$. This metric and distance can be used to obtain a more precise result compared with the widely used Euclidean distance, which is usually used in signal classification.},
