abstract: "Topological data analysis provides a brandnew viewpoint in modern data science. Traditional methods, using linear algebra and statistics, fails exploring the global information about data when the intrinsic space is a nonlinear manifold. However, topologyenables data scientists to gain global insights into large data sets. In this talk we’ll first give a brief introduction to persistent homology and its applications to show how topology works in data science. Next, we’ll report our latest progress on computing high dimensional persistence, which is a nice combination between Bayesian inference and algebraic topology. We’ll also report our new method in computing Gaussian curvature and characteristic classes for point cloud data. Finally, we discuss some open problems in topological data analysis and manifold learning."
